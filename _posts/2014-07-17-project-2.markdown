description: A basic chat room app built using Rails and Google Firebase.

#### Summary

ConfabbingApp is a simple chat room app where participants can create chat rooms and chat in those rooms. All rooms are available to all the users at any given time after they sign-up/sign-in.

#### Project set-up
I built this single page web application with AngularJS for the frontend and Google Firebase for authentication and data storage.  
This was my first project using Firebase for authentication and storage. I used the auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword API to register the users and allow them to sign_in with their email.

<!-- With the help of the [Firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) initializing firebase on index.html as follows: -->

<!-- ```javascript
var config = {

  apiKey: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  authDomain: "bloc-test-aebd8.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://bloc-test-aebd8.firebaseio.com",
  storageBucket: "bloc-test-aebd8.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "****************"
};
firebase.initializeApp(config);


auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword
auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged

``` -->

<!-- Using the above calls to firebase a user can either sign-up/sign-in or enter an already logged-in session. -->

On success, a user can start chatting in any of the Confabbing rooms or create a new Confab room.

roomCtrl (controller) and roomService (service) handle the messages sent accross the room for a user.

```javascript
service.addRoom
service.displayRoom
service.send
service.updateUserInFB
service.logout
```
The above calls to the roomService take care of all the operations of this Simple Chat room.

The user/room model in the Firebase is as shown below.
